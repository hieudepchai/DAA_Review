# Principles of object-oriented design
<div style="text-align: justify">

* Modularity

Modern software systems typically consist of several different components that must interact correctly in order for the entire system to work properly

* Abstraction

The notion of abstraction is to distill a complicated system down to its most fundamental parts

Applying the abstraction paradigm to the design of
data structures gives rise to abstract data types. An ADT specifies what each operation does, but not how it does it. We will typically refer to the
collective set of behaviors supported by an ADT as its public interface. 

* Encapsulation

Modern software systems typically consist of several different components that must interact correctly in order for the entire system to work properly

 One of the main advantages of encapsulation is that it
gives one programmer freedom to implement the details of a component, withou concern that other programmers will be writing code that intricately depends on
those internal decisions.

* Inheritance

Inheritance is the process by which one class takes on the attributes and methods of another
